Ages 1-4
Cybersecurity for Toddlers
At the tender age of 1 to 4, children aren’t sending emails or scrolling through social media
feeds. Still, their exposure to the digital world has already begun. It’s an age characterized by
rapid learning, boundless curiosity, and, let’s face it – random screen taps. So, where does
cybersecurity fit into this picture?

Ages 5-8
Cybersecurity for Young Children
As children transition from toddlers to the young child stage, their digital interactions often
become more frequent and varied. They’re no longer just tapping aimlessly; they’re engaging,
exploring, and discovering the internet.

Ages 9-12
Cybersecurity for Pre-teens
The transition from childhood to adolescence is marked by an expanding horizon of personal
experiences. Pre-teens are increasingly carving out their own niches online, whether through
joining multiplayer games, starting social media profiles, or exploring new areas of interest.
However, this age group also treads a fine line: they have a more sophisticated grasp of
technology yet still lack the maturity to recognize all its nuances and pitfalls.

Ages 13-17
Cybersecurity for Teenagers
While the following advice is targeted towards teenagers, let’s be clear: many adults could
benefit from these reminders too. As we highlighted above about pre-teens, discussing
cybersecurity and cyberbullying is an ongoing dialogue, not a one-off lecture. It’s as crucial for
teenagers, if not more so, given their increasing digital independence.
